# Final-Exam-Review

This repository holds all of the source code I developed for reviewing purposes in preparation for the PROG71985 course final exam. The code is written in C language,
and includes an example per topic discussed and evaluated throughout the semester. My gratitude goes to Dr. Steve H. for his time with spent us teaching the course, and Stephen
Prata, author of the C Primer Plus textbook I used to lean C programming.

# Topics

The topics covered in this review go as follows:
- Print Statements and basic Input / Output.
- Conditionals, Booleans, and Looping.
- Linked Lists, ADTs, Structures, and Arrays of Structures.
- File I/O, and Command Line Arguments.
- Recursion (Comming Soon).

# Additional Preparation

In addition to developing source code material, I also studied theory notes from the aforementioned, C Primer Plus textbook, and wrote some mockup, theory quizzes with
the purpose of testing and strenghtening my theoretical understanding of the C programming language.
